From time to time, check the exam topics list for updates:
http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-144

Following are topics not explicitly listed in the exam but likely to be tested
[  ] Distinguish between SQL and PL/SQL data types
[  ] SQL and PL/SQL types that have an implicit NOT NULL constraint
[  ] Which SQL functions are available in PL/SQL and which are not 
     (remember SQL function can be made available in PL/SQL using the SELECT INTO clause)

QUESTIONS
001. Are DEFAULT and (:=) always interchangeble in PL/SQL ? YES, they are.
