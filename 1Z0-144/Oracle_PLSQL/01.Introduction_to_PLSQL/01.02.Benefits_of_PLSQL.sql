Thight integration with SQL
========================================
- You can execute DML, TCL, cursor control
- PL/SQL can use existing SQL functions
- PL/SQL supports SQl data types without need of conversion


High Performance
========================================

Bind Variables
----------------------------------------
When you embed a SQL INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, or SELECT statement 
directly in your PL/SQL code, the PL/SQL compiler turns the variables in 
the WHERE and VALUES clauses into bind variables (for details, see 
"Resolution of Names in Static SQL Statements"). Oracle Database can 
reuse these SQL statements each time the same code runs, which improves 
performance.

PL/SQL does not create bind variables automatically when you use dynamic 
SQL, but you can use them with dynamic SQL by specifying them explicitly 
(for details, see "EXECUTE IMMEDIATE Statement").

Subprograms
----------------------------------------
Because stored subprograms run in the database server, a single 
invocation over the network can start a large job. Reducing network traffic 
and improving response times. Stored subprograms are cached and shared among 
users, which lowers memory requirements and invocation overhead.


Optimizer
----------------------------------------
The PL/SQL compiler has an optimizer that can rearrange code for better 
performance. For more information about the optimizer, see "PL/SQL Optimizer".
